# Minesweeper

A minesweeper game I wrote when I was bored

## How to play

- Left click to reveal a square
- Right click to flag or unflag a square

## Customise

### The game can be adjusted using the following variables, which are found in lines 136-142

- gridSize: number of squares in grid = gridSize x gridSize
- size: relative window size
- mines: number of mines
- colours: colours of numbers (for mines in vicinity)
- lines: colour of grid lines
- background: colour of the background
- discovered: colour of a discovered square
